## Building the ROM
NOTE: On Windows, [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is required. I am currently unable to verify whether or not the repo can be built on macOS.

1. Clone the repo: `$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/DevEd2/potion-panic`
2. Run `build.sh`. If you get a "permission denied" error, run `chmod -x build.sh` and try again.
